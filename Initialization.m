function [P0,X0,Pose] = Initialization(frame1,frame2, K)
%INITIALIZATION Initialize the states and pose (with respect to worldframe (1st frame)) using 2 initial frames (1st and 3rd suggested)
%   -keypoints detection (harris) and matching (KLT) 
%   -Calculate relative pose (8-points or 5-points) and triangulate 3D point cloud and outlier rejection (RANSAC)
% Kp: keypoints count; 
% P_0 [2 x Kp]: keypoints;
% X_0 [3 x Kp]: 3D Landmarks (relative tp P0); 
% Pose [R|T]: pose with respect to worldframe; 
% R: relative rotation matrix (to express point from frame 2 to frame 1); 
% T: relative translation (to express point from frame 2 to frame 1);
